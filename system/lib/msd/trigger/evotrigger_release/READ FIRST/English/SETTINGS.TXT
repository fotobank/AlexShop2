1) configure "daten.ini" like your data to access your htaccess secured webspace:

   USERNAME;PASSWORD;WWW.DOMAIN.DE/DIRECTORY/dump.php;MAXRUNTIME

1.1) DONT enter "http://", evotrigger does it for you!

1.2) MAXLRUNTIME is an integer of a full number (z.B.: 7 - for seven minutes).
     for the maxruntime of seven minutes the opened explorerwindow will be
     closed. all the same whatever the dump is already running.

2) by one of the last official windows xp updates, the security options from the IE
   where modded. if the evotrigger wont works doubleclick the "IEPatch.reg" and add them
   to your registry. restart your system (try it at first without regpatch and without 
   restart if you need the patch).


INFO: daten.ini have to be in the same directory / folder where the evotrigger.exe is!


ATTENTION: if you dont use htaccess the daten.ini must looks like this:

           ;;WWW.DOMAIN.DE/DIRECTORY/dump.php;MAXRUNTIME
