    	This is a demo example of how to implement ContentLock into your project
		There is no any special HTML markup, all you need to add is data attribute
		that will hold the created lock, and passing the parent container (of the content you want 
		to lock) ID attribute when initializing the plugin. You will need to assign ID to the container if
		you do not have it already. Also if you want multiple elements to get locked, just wrap them with some
		container, like DIV, or SECTION and assing it an ID that will be passed when initializing the plugin.
		To assign single lock to the container add it as data-cl attribute, and to assign it group lock add it
		as data-group attribute, like shown in code below. If you want to include Subscribe Box in the lock
		so that user can automatically receive password when subscribed, add data-subox="true" attribute. For
		downloads add data-dwn attribute and pass it the url to the file that will be downloaded. If you want
		to lock complete page just add appropriate data attribute for the type of lock you want to use and assing
		an ID if you do not have one already to the main page wrapper, and then pass it's ID to the container
		parameter when initializing the plugin.
